# infra-diff

> **Status**: 🚧 Under Active Development

A GitHub Action that provides a user-friendly preview of infrastructure changes based on Terraform, Terragrunt, or OpenTofu plan files. The action reads plan files in both JSON and binary formats, converts binary files as needed, and displays colorized diffs with collapsible sections for easy review of proposed infrastructure changes.

## Implementation Roadmap

This project is being developed incrementally according to a phased approach. See [`features/phase-1.md`](./features/phase-1.md) for the detailed feature outline and implementation plan for the MVP.
